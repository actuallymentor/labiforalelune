### OUR PHILOSOPHY

Slow country o Slow life
Our is the philosophy of beauty. Our guest must be imbued with beauty that is around us. The mountains metaphysical and essential, Giottesque and Tibetan. The Campo Imperatore and the Gran Sasso: to experience them, to see them is an emotion that expresses the kind of feeling of loneliness that comes to us with regard to the grandeur of nature. And the breath of the old culture, a stone village, the old tower with battlements signed by the earthquake, the medieval streets. Fields as painted by an impressionist or pointillist painter or directly by Giotto himself: his long stripes of land, green, brown, colors and floral art.

A heroic agriculture survives in the windswept highlands with its strong and blinding light. The choice of natural and slow crops. The plants grow tedious and as far as possible they produce natural seeds. There grow almost wild lentils, chickpeas, grass peas, archaeological wheat, barley and spelled.
The fort Calascio looks down on everything, hard but soft at the same time as a castle, a vision, a sense of light ocher can be.

The trips to Campo Imperatore, Gondole, Locce, the Valle Francuccia, at Prata, the valley of the Valley Voltigno Strina, are like time traveling in the breath of the wilderness as a natural garden. Climbers climb the ledges and ‘alpine towers’ of the Apennines. Apennines also reminiscent of the sea which is very near with her breathing she gives taste to the Mediterranean wind that will blow.

Finally, our accommodation of stone, with Bifore windows in 15th century style, breathe the scent of Siena and Florence, which Santo Stefano was in a feud, the atmosphere of Rome, which remains the region Abruzzo L’Aquila drenched by the geographical proximity of a strong story.
In short, the mystique of the Romanesque churches, arid valleys, of medieval paintings, the colors of the land, a land of flavors and slow and far away. Slow life.
